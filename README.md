## Setup

### Dependencies

Run `yarn` on root folder to install dependencies related to Express.

`cd client` and run `yarn` install dependencies related to React.

### Run Your Development Servers

- Run `yarn start` in project directory to start both the Express server on port 5000 and client server in development mode with hot reloading in port 3000.
- Client is configured so all API calls will be proxied to port 5000 for a smoother development experience. Yay!
- You can test your client app in `http://localhost:3000`
- You can test your API in `http://localhost:5000/api`
